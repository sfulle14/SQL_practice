These are some files I created to help speed up some of my current work tasks. I have regular base templates that 
I have to create so I made a script to help automate some of that work. With these scripts I am able to take the templete
SELECT statement that Microsoft SQL Server provieds you and create an INSET statement with it. Saving time and money by not
having to manually type this for each new table.
